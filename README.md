# Humble Trove Tracker

This project presents games that were available in Humble Trove before it was
discontinued. It tracks when the game was added and when it was subsequently
removed.

We do not have the data from roughly June 2021 and until the middle of January
2022, since the data was not collected in that period. This implies that we
might have missed games that were added and removed in that time period. We also
cannot know for certain when exactly the game, that existed before June 2021,
was removed before January 2022. Luckily, all games, that were still available
as of January 2022, have information when they were added to Hubmle Trove, so
that data is certain.

## Prior work
